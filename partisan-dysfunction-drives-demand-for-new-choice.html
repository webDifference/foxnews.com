              <p> It’s a pretty high price to pay for membership in organizations that seem mostly devoted to self-perpetuation.&nbsp;</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> The way American parties have typically worked in the past 150 years has mostly been a force for good. Forcing popular sentiment through twin cooling towers, right and left, has mostly tended to keep things calmer and allow for decisive action when needed.</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> Watching&nbsp;<b>Angela Merkel</b>&nbsp;currently trying to sew together a pair of lederhosen out of the scraps of a dozen different parties illustrates the value of our two-party republic. Our kooks and nuts are first in line in the primary nominating process, yes. But they aren’t in a position to hold the whole government hostage at the end.</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  <div class="ad-container mobile ad-h-250">

              <p> And the deal was pretty good for members of the parties, too.</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> In exchange for votes, contributions and participation, a partisan could mostly feel that their preferred policies were being pursued. And, they could also take pride in belonging to something bigger than themselves. Parties were for good ideas, but also for good people.&nbsp;</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> Now, when we see a sticker or a shirt proudly proclaiming membership in either party, we think “Have you seen the news? You might want to keep that under wraps just now…”</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> We have written many times before about the consequences of negative purpose in politics, but this bears repeating: Any organization that exists mainly to block another one will tend to devolve to the perceived rottenness of the opposition.</p>

It’s an increasingly bad (and embarrassing) deal. And that trend is just getting warmed up.</p>

Yes, younger Americans continue to dislike Republicans more than Democrats. But even if the red team is in even worse odor with young voters than usual, that’s no glad news for the blue team.</p>

              <p> By the time that generation gets into the electoral driver’s seat in the next five to ten years, those numbers may be down, but probably not enough to protect an increasingly dysfunctional status quo.</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> Plus as moderate and ethically minded voters flee the major parties, that will continue to intensify the hold that charlatans and cranks have. That means further flight of the thoughtful and decent. Grossness begets grossness, and so on.</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> It’s been more than 160 years since the beginning of an enduring new party, but it would be hard not to think that the political moment of opportunity isn’t at hand. The stunning failures of the existing duopoly and the degree to which technology has lowered barriers to entry make this a fertile time.</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> So what would work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> Yes, the rise of the Republican Party was a function of the inability of the Whigs to coherently address the most pressing issue of their time, slavery.</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> But that’s not why the Republican Party’s unlikely success in 1860 turned into two generations of political hyper-dominance. Obviously, having the electoral stronghold of your rival party under military occupation for 14 years does tend to offer some structural advantages. But the rapid rise to prolonged power for the ironically named Grand Old Party was because the new party embraced – and was embraced by – the growing merchant and managerial class that was budding from America’s industrial boom.&nbsp;</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> Democrats were beholden to three groups: Revenge-minded Southerners, mostly poor immigrants in the Northeast and the anti-industrial prairie populists of the West. Any party that had to accommodate the likes of&nbsp;<b>Nathan Bedford Forrest</b>,&nbsp;<b>Boss Tweed</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>William Jennings Bryan</b>&nbsp;didn’t have much room left in the tent to accommodate innovation.</p>
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              <p> The party that could accommodate that new energy not only endured but thrived. If someone figures out how to harness the dissatisfaction of the 71 percent of young people let down by the current system, they’ll have a winner.</p>

Despite record coffee production in Latin American countries, the growing demand for the bean from both military and civilian sources, and the demands placed on shipping, which was needed for other purposes, required the limiting of its availability. Scarcity or shortages were rarely the reason for rationing during the war. Rationing was generally employed for two reasons: (1) to guarantee a fair distribution of resources and foodstuffs to all citizens; and (2) to give priority to military use for certain raw materials, given the present emergency. At first, limiting the use of certain products was voluntary. For example,&nbsp;<b>President Roosevelt</b>&nbsp;launched ‘scrap drives’ to scare up throwaway rubber-old garden hoses, tires, bathing caps, etc.–in light of the Japanese capture of the Dutch East Indies, a source of rubber for the United States. Collections were then redeemed at gas stations for a penny a pound.”</p>

Why? What reason does he have to craft this episode of Apprentice in this fashion? Did Nancy and Chuck fall neatly into his trap?

As we wrote on Tuesday, Trump has obvious reasons to rough up the Democratic congressional leaders ahead of his tax pitch with Senate Republicans. Similarly, they had good reason to express such deep umbrage at Trump’s taunt. What we will find out in the next four weeks is who has the greater pain threshold as consequences of inaction start to pile up.</i>]<i>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </i>“Most everyone is painfully aware of the continuing discord in DC, regarding the new ‘tax plan.’&nbsp; I have several thoughts, on which I would appreciate your comments. First - logic tells me that, perhaps, the corporate tax should be completely done away with; profits passed directly to shareholders, and they be taxed at that level. Second, as I understand it - most spending programs adopted by Congress do not have specified dates for ending, or renewal.&nbsp;Last, why should it be that ‘pork’ can be hung on bills, where it is totally irrelevant?” –&nbsp;<b><i>Ernie Weaver</i></b><i>, North Port, Fla.<br /> <br /> </i>[<i>Ed. note: A word about “budget reconciliation,” Mr. Weaver. In order to expedite the budget process in the 1970’s, the Senate adopted rules that allowed for the perfunctory business of budgeting to be handled on bare-majority votes. To make sure that the train didn’t go too far off track, the rules require that taxes and spending basically balance out over a 10 year window. This was not a problem back when Congress passed the budget and when both parties actually paid more than lip service to issues of debt and deficit. Unable to govern through normal procedure anymore, the Senate has come to rely on the budget backdoor to try to pass large-scale initiatives. What was supposed to make ordinary business easier has ended up being a tool for extraordinary measures while the basics have come to be nearly impossible.</i>&nbsp;<i>One of the reasons that legislation often takes such weird forms is because of the effort to conform to the arbitrary 10-year window. Lawmakers try to game the Congressional Budget Office with fiscal tricks to try to get things to add up in the end, focused on painting political outcomes rather than good policy.</i>]</p>
